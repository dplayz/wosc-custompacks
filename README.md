These are the guides for pushing announcements
- Firstly, fork this repository pointing to *immediatedata* branch for urgent commit which is common to resource pack, and to *beta* for non urgent, minor and major releases
- Always update the manifest.json and world_resource_packs.json or world_behavior_packs to finish
- To always update the branches, pull the *main* branch and merge it to *immediatedata* or *beta*
- Follow the formats of the announcements
- Auto deploy is scheduled every 11:45AM and 11:45PM UTC+08, so always request an update 30 minutes or earlier than deployment time.
