## Dependencies
We are dependent on these addon for the server.  
- [FoxyNoTail's One Player Sleep](https://foxynotail.com/addons/ops/)
- [Lockable Chest Addon](https://mcpedl.com/lockable-chests-addon-1/)
- [Bonsai Addon](https://mcpedl.com/easy-bonsai-add-on/)

<p>We are not stealing them, we're making it work to the server. This is the reason why the dependencies are only available within the main server</p>
