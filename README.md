## Dependencies
We are dependent on these addon for the server. 
- [FoxyNoTail's One Player Sleep](https://foxynotail.com/addons/ops/)
- [Lockable Chest Addon](https://mcpedl.com/lockable-chests-addon-1/)
- [Java Debug Menu](https://mcpedl.com/java-debug-screen-addon/)
- [Bonsai Addon](https://mcpedl.com/easy-bonsai-add-on/)
- [Dynamic Light Source Addon](https://mcpedl.com/dynamic-light-sources/)

We are not stealing them, we're making it work to the server. This is the reason why the dependencies are only available within the main server
